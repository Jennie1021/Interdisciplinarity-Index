# KU interdisciplinary-index

## Motivation
* Students might be underestimated if we evaluate them with their GPA only. I thought it's time to change our perspective.
* We value students who are willing to stepping up to challenges even in taking courses! In other words, we value students who tried to build up interdisciplinary academic knowledge.

## How to calculate then?

## Which administration can benefit from the index?
* CTL(Center for Teaching and Learning) requested the index to nominate students who would share their various class taking experiences at orientations for new professors.
